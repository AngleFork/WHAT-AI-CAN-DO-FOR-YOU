# What AI can do for your Company

"A hundred years ago electricity transformed countless industries; 20 years ago the internet did, too. Artificial intelligence is about to do the same. To take advantage, companies need to understand what AI can do." - Andrew Ng | https://hbr.org/2016/11/hiring-your-first-chief-ai-officer

The following is constructed in accordance with the following three guidelines:

- From outline to detail
- From generic to specific areas
- Focus on state-of-the-art
