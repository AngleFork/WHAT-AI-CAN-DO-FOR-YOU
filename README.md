# WHAT AI CAN DO FOR YOUR COMPANY

**SOLVING Fortune 500’s Toughest Challenges with AI**

"*A hundred years ago electricity transformed countless industries; 20 years ago the internet did, too. Artificial intelligence is about to do the same. To take advantage, companies need to understand what AI can do.*" - Andrew Ng | https://hbr.org/2016/11/hiring-your-first-chief-ai-officer

If you are a *C-suite* newcomer to the AI, the first question you may have is "**_What AI can do now and how it relates to my strategies?_**" Since early deployment gives an advantage, here are the state-of-the-art AI papers and `CODE` for any industry.

# Industry | What AI | Papers | `CODE`

The following is constructed in accordance with the following three guiding principles:

1. *Focus on state-of-the-art*;
2. *From generic to specific areas*; and
3. *Clarity, efficiency and transparency*.

Being able to deploy with the least possible delay is key.

Because AI talent is *extremely scarce* right now:

“*Last year, the cost of a top, world-class deep learning expert was about the same as a top NFL quarterback prospect. The cost of that talent is pretty remarkable.*” - Peter Lee, Vice President, Microsoft
